# 2: Understand what an ANOVA is even doing/ what sort of data is appropriate for it. 

## It's important to understand what TYPE of data you need in ANOVA. An ANOVA is
## basically just seeing if there is statistically significant difference
## between the groups of a IV on some outcome variable. 

## So you need the IV to be categorical and the DV to be continuous.

# Look at the structure of the data and the type of variables in it

```{r}
str(movie_data)

```

```{r}
summary(movie_data)
